In Python, **data types** specify what kind of data a value  represents and the operations that can be performed on that value.
Python has many data types, but we'll start with some fundamental ones:

- **int**: Represents whole numbers such as `5`, `-3`.
- **float**: Represents numbers with decimal points, like `3.14`, `-0.001`.
- **str**: Represents strings or sequences of characters, for example, `'hello'`, `"Python"`.

Note that strings are enclosed in quotes, whereas integers and floating-point numbers are not.
