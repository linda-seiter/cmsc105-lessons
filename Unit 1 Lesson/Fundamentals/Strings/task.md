A Python **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed
in single or double quotes. A string that embeds a single quote must be enclosed in double quotes, and vice versa.

| String                         | Description                              |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 'The table needs to be moved.' | Single quotes                            |
| "Will it fit through the door?" | Double quotes                            |
| "What's the table width?"      | Double quotes enclose<br> a single quote |
| 'The table is 40" wide.'       | Single quotes enclose<br> a double quote |
