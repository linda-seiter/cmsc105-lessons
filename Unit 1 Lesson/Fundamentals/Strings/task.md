The print() function  takes one or more expressions,
such as strings or numbers, and displays them as output.

A Python **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed
in single quotes (') or double quotes (").
It is used to represent text data in Python.

Here are sample strings. Notice the last two strings
contain embedded quotes. If a string embeds a single quote,
it must be enclosed in double quotes, and vice versa.

| String                         | Description                                  |
|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| 'The table needs to be moved.' | Single quotes                                |
| "Will it fit through the door?" | Double quotes                                |
| "What's the table width?"      | Double quotes<br> enclose a<br> single quote |
| 'The table is 40" wide.'       | Single quotes<br> enclose a<br> double quote |

Run the code in `print_example.py`:

 - The print() function displays as output the text inside the single or double quotes, but the
surrounding quotes themselves are not printed.
