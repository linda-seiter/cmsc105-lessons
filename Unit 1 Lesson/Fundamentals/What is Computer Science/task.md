Computer Science is often viewed as a science, but it differs 
from traditional fields like biology or physics. 
While those study the natural world, Computer Science focuses on 
designing and creating systems that process information.
 
Computer Science is focused on using computers to solve
problemsâ€”developing algorithms, writing code, and creating
software and systems to tackle real-world challenges.

Though Computer Scientists use many tools to solve problems, 
programming is their primary one.

## What is a Program?

A **program** is a set of instructions written in a 
programming language that tells a computer what to do. 
It can perform a specific task, like adding numbers, 
displaying a webpage, or running a game. 

In this course, you will learn how to write programs using the **Python** programming language.
