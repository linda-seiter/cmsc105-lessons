**Natural Languages** are the languages humans use to
communicate with each other, like English, French, and so on.
These languages weren’t consciously created; instead, they developed naturally over time.

**Formal Languages** are languages created by humans
for specific purposes. Programming languages are a
type of formal language designed to express computations
and give instructions to computers. For example, when we
write a Python program, we're giving the computer a
set of commands.

Just like natural languages, programming languages need
to follow specific rules to be meaningful.

These rules fall into two categories:

**Syntax:** The structure, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of the language.
**Semantics:** The meaning, logic, and intent behind the code.

## Syntax

Consider the following:

```text
Th?is does .not make sense
```


In English, we follow grammar rules to construct proper
sentences. If a sentence violates these rules, it's
considered incorrect. The same applies in Python—if
you misuse symbols, spaces, or keywords, you'll
encounter a "syntax error." Expect to make a few
of these as you start learning to program.

## Semantics

Consider the following:

```text
The sad shoe ate a car.
```

Although the sentence follows grammar rules and has no
syntax errors, it doesn’t make sense! Semantics is
all about meaning. In Python, you can write code that
is syntactically correct but still doesn’t accomplish
anything useful.
