## Editor

The <b>Editor</b> is your playground where you will be programming. You can experiment here while you work on theoretical tasks and quizzes without being checked.

For programming assignments, the Editor is where youâ€™ll fix the existing code or write your own code from scratch. This code will be checked.

<style>
img {
  display: block;
  margin-left: auto;
  margin-right: auto;
}
</style>
<img src="editor.png" class="center" width=600>


To run your code at any time,  
right-click anywhere in the **Editor** view so you can see the context menu,
then choose the Run option from the context menu.  You can also
run a program by pressing <span style="color: #509DD6">&shortcut:Run;</span>:
