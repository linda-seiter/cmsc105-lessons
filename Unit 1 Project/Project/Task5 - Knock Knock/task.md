# Task 5 - Knock-Knock Joke

## Learning Outcomes

- Capture multiple values from user input and assign them to variables
- Produce multiple lines of formatted output

Consider the following program requirements:

<i>Write a program to generate a knock-knock joke by reading in two input values: (1) who is at the door, and (2) the punchline.
The program should output a knock-knock joke using the values read from user input.
</i>

The table below provides examples of input and the corresponding expected output (apologies for the cheesiness):

INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Edit the code to implement the specified input/output functionality.
2. Run the code several times to test with different input values. Confirm the correct output is produced.
3. Once you've confirmed the program I/O is correct, press the Check button to run the tests. Fix any errors identified by the test.
