# Task 2 - Favorite Things

## Learning Outcomes

- Assign a value to a variable
- Print the value of a variable
- Utilize an f-string to generate formatted output

### Instructions

The code assigns a variable named `favorite_color`, and then uses string concatenation with the `+` operator
to display the favorite color.

1. Edit the header comment to list yourself as the author.
2. Add a statement to create a new variable named `favorite_food` and assign it to your personal favorite food.
3. Add a `print` statement to output the `favorite_food` variable in a message (replace pizza with your favorite):
   - My favorite food is pizza.
4. Run the code to see the output.
5. Click the `Check` button to test the program. The test checks for (1) the assignment of the `favorite_food` variable and (2) a statement that prints the variable.

For example, if your favorite color is blue and favorite food is chocolate cake, the program would output:

```text
My favorite color is blue.
My favorite food is chocolate cake.
```
