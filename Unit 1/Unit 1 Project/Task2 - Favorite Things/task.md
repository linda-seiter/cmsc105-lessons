# Task 2 - Favorite Things

## Learning Outcomes

- Assign a value to a variable
- Print the value of a variable

### Instructions

The code in `unit1_task2.py` currently assigns a variable `favorite_color` and uses the `print()` function to display a message about the favorite color.

1. Update the header comment to list yourself as the author.
2. Create an additional variable named `favorite_food` and assign it your favorite food.
3. Add a `print` statement to display the `favorite_food` variable in a message. For example, if your favorite color is blue and your favorite food is chocolate cake, the output would be:
```text
My favorite color is blue
My favorite food is chocolate cake
```
4. Run the code to view the output.
5. Click the `Check` button to test the program. The test checks (1) the `favorite_food` variable is assigned and (2) the `favorite_food` variable is printed.
