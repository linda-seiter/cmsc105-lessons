# Task 4 - Knock-Knock Joke

## Learning Outcomes

- Get multiple values from user input and assign them to variables.
- Display multiple lines of output.

Hereâ€™s the program description:

<i>Write a program to create a knock-knock joke by reading two input values: (1) who is at the door, and (2) the punchline. The program should then output a knock-knock joke using the values provided by the user.</i>

The table below provides examples of input and the corresponding expected output (apologies for the cheesiness):

| Test | Expected I/O                                                                                                                                                                             | 
|------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Who is at the door: <b>Siri</b><br>What is the punchline: <b>Siri-ously, stop telling jokes!</b><br>Knock-knock.<br>Who's there?<br>Siri<br>Siri who?<br>Siri-ously, stop telling jokes! |
