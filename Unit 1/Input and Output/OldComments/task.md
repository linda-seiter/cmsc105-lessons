## Comments

TODO: Redo as I/O task

Comments in Python start with the hash character (`#`)
and they extend to the end of the physical line.

- Comments are used to clarify program logic and make the code understandable.
- You can also comment out a line of code if you don't want temporarily prevent its execution without  deleting it.
- Comments should be complete yet succinct sentences.  
- Don't use comments to explain obvious functionality as this clutters the code.

You can read more about proper commenting in <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#comments">PEP 8 â€“ Style Guide for Python Code</a>. 

### Task
The code in comments.py does not produce the expected output.
In the code editor, comment the line with the `print` statement that says it should not be printed. 
See how the code is not highlighted anymore.

<div class="hint">
  Add a <code>#</code> and a space before the last <code>print</code> statement to prevent its execution.
</div>
