# Task 3 - Great Major

## Learning Outcomes

- Prompt the user for input and store it in a variable
- Produce formatted output based on the input value

Consider the following program requirements:

<i>Write a program to take the user's academic major as input
and print a message that affirms it as a great major.</i>


The table below shows examples of input and their expected output, with the input values highlighted in bold.

| Test | Expected I/O                                                                                    | 
|------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Enter your major: <b>Computer Science</b><br>Computer Science is a great major!                 | 
| 2    | Enter your major: <b>Cybersecurity Technology</b><br>Cybersecurity Technology is a great major! |       
| 3    | Enter your major: <b>Web and Digital Design</b><br>Web and Digital Design is a great major!     |       


INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Edit the code to implement the program requirements.  
   - Store the user input in a variable.  Pick a good name for the variable such as `major` or `academic_major`.
   - Use string concatenation to produce the expected output.
2. Run the code several times to test with different input values for academic major. Confirm the output correctly includes the major supplied as input.
3. Once you've confirmed the program I/O is correct, press the Check button to run the tests.
