**Natural languages** are the languages that humans
use to communicate with one another,
such as English, Spanish, and others.
These languages were not intentionally created; rather, they evolved naturally over time
through social interaction.

**Formal Languages** are languages created by humans
for specific purposes. Programming languages are a
type of formal language designed to express computation
and give instructions to computers. 

Just like natural languages, programming languages need
to follow specific rules to be meaningful.

These rules fall into two categories:

- **Syntax:** The structure, grammar, spelling, and punctuation of the programming language.
- **Semantics:** The meaning, logic, and intent of the code.

## Syntax

Consider the following:

```text
Th?is does .not make sense
```

In English, we follow grammar rules to construct proper
sentences. If a sentence violates these rules, it's
considered incorrect. The same applies in Python—if
you misuse symbols, spaces, or keywords, you'll
encounter a *syntax error*. It is common to make syntax errors as you start learning to program.

## Semantics

Consider the following:

```text
The sad shoe ate a car.
```

Although the sentence follows grammar rules and has no
syntax errors, it doesn’t make sense! Semantics is
all about meaning. In Python, you can write code that
is syntactically correct but still doesn’t accomplish
anything useful.
