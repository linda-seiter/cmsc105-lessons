Although Computer Science is regarded as a science, it differs from traditional fields like biology or physics. While those disciplines focus on studying the natural world, Computer Science is focused on designing and building systems that process information.

The primary goal of Computer Science is to use computers to solve problemsâ€”this involves developing algorithms, writing code, and building software and systems to address real-world challenges.

While Computer Scientists use various tools to solve problems, programming is their primary tool.
## What is a Program?

A **program** is a collection of instructions written in a programming language that tells a computer what actions to perform. It can execute specific tasks, such as adding numbers, displaying a webpage, or running a game.
