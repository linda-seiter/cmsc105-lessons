The Python print() function is used to display output.

A function is called by using its name followed by
parentheses. It can accept one or more comma-separated values,
known as arguments, which are passed inside
the parentheses. Since Python is case-sensitive,
the `print()` function must always be written in
lowercase letters.

| Function Call   | Description                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| print('Hello')  | Valid function call.                                             
| print(7)        | Valid function call.                                             
| print('Hmmm)    | Invalid function call.<br>The string is missing a closing quote. |
| print("Welcome" | Invalid function call.<br>The closing parenthesis is missing.    |
| PRINT("Hi")     | Unknown function PRINT.                                          |
