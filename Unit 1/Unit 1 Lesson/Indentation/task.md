In Python, indentation is used to define the structure
of the code. There is an indentation error in `main.py` that prevents
the code from running. 
- Line 1 and 3 are correct in that there are no spaces before the `print()` function call.
- Line 2 has an indentation error due to the extra spaces at the beginning of the line. The red underlines on line 2 indicates an error.

Try running `main.py`. You should see an error message similar to the following:

## Code Challenge

Fix the error by removing the extra indentation in line 2, then
re-run the program and confirm 3 lines of output.


<div class="hint">
print('Line 1.')<br>
print('Line 2.')<br>
print('Line 3.')
</div>
