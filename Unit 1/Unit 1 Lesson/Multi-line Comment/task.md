Multi-line comments are written with triple 
quotes (''' or """) and can span across several lines.

```python
"""
This is a multi-line comment.
This comment spans cross three lines.
Triple double quotes were used, although single quotes work as well.
"""
```

We often use a multi-line comment at the top of each Python file to
document the code purpose, author, creation date, and version, as shown in `main.py`.
