While `=` is used for equality in math, it is important to note that in Python the `=` operator is used for assignment, not equality.

```python
# Assign values to variables
fruit = 'apples'
price_per_lb = 1.25
pounds = 3
```

When you see the assignment statement,
say to yourself *“pounds is assigned the value 3”*. Don’t say *“pounds equals 3”*.

- **Correct:** `fruit` is assigned the value 'apples'.
- **Incorrect:** `fruit` equals 'apples'.
