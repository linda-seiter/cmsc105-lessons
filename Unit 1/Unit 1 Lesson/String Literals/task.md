A Python **string** is a sequence of characters enclosed in either single or double quotes. A **string literal** refers to the specific text or value of the string written directly in the code, such as `"Hello"` or `'World'`. Often, we use the term "string" when we are actually referring to a string literal, and in most cases, there's no need to make a distinction.
A string that embeds a single quote must be enclosed in double quotes, and vice versa.


| String  Literal                 | Description                              |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 'The table needs to be moved.'  | Single quotes                            |
| "Will it fit through the door?" | Double quotes                            |
| "What's the table width?"       | Double quotes enclose<br> a single quote |
| 'The table is 40" wide.'        | Single quotes enclose<br> a double quote |
