While `=` is used for equality in math, it's important to understand that in Python, the `=` operator is used for assignment, not for checking equality.

```python
# Assign values to variables
fruit = 'apples'
price_per_lb = 1.25
pounds = 3
```

When you encounter an assignment statement, think of it as *“pounds is assigned the value 3”* rather than *“pounds equals 3”*.

- **Correct:** `fruit` is assigned the value 'apples'.
- **Incorrect:** `fruit` equals 'apples'.

We'll cover the equality operator `==` in a future lesson when we learn how to compare values.
