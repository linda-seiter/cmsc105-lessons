The `io_challenge.py` program prompts the user for their name and displays a greeting, as shown in the "Actual I/O" column below. Note that I/O stands for Input/Output.

| Expected I/O                                                                                | Actual I/O                                     |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| What is your name: <b>Abel</b><br>Where do you live: <b>France</b><br>Hi Abel from France   | What is your name: <b>Abel</b><br>Hi Abel   |
| What is your name: <b>Jelay</b><br>Where do you live: <b>Canada</b><br>Hi Jelay from Canada | What is your name: <b>Jelay</b><br>Hi Jelay |

The program currently skips the period at the end of the sentence. We'll learn how to create properly formatted output in a later lesson.
## Code Challenge

After prompting for the name, the code should prompt for the country and store the user input in a new variable named `country`. 

Update the print statement to display both the name and country as shown in the expected output.  

Remember, you can pass multiple arguments to the `print()` function, separated by commas, and the values will be printed on a single line with spaces between them.
