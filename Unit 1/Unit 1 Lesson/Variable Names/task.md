In Python, a valid variable name must adhere to these rules:

- It must begin with a letter or an underscore (`_`).
- After the first character, it can only contain letters, digits, and underscores.
- It cannot contain spaces.
- It cannot be a Python keyword.

Variables starting with an underscore have a special meaning, but for now, we will use letters to start variable names.

Python is case-sensitive, and while uppercase letters are allowed, it's best practice to avoid them to prevent case-related errors.

The underscore character (`_`) is commonly used in multi-word variable names, such as `price_per_lb`.

We'll cover Python keywords in more detail in later lessons.


### Examples of legal variable names:
- `fruit`
- `price_per_lb`
- `hour2`

### Examples of illegal variable names:
- `1fruit` (cannot start with a digit)
- `my variable` (spaces are not allowed)
- `for` (a reserved keyword)
